# ProgramingAssignmet3 - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

### What's on this assignment
There is one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

* Downloads and extract the data if it's not available in the working directory.
* Replaces the activity names for descriptive activity names.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

There is also a CodeBook.md file  indicating all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
